# Face_Recognition_with_CPP
This project is a complete C++ application built with OpenCV to perform face detection and recognition. The system captures face images from a webcam, stores them in a dataset, trains a face recognition model (using Eigenfaces or Fisherfaces), and performs real-time recognition using a webcam feed.
